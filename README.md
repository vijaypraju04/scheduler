## Future Improvements

### Product and User Experience (UX) Enhancements

#### Enhanced User Interface Design
- Implement a modern and intuitive design system to make the platform visually appealing.
- Improve the responsiveness and accessibility of the application for better user experience across all devices (varying breakpoints).

#### User Feedback Mechanism
- Add a feedback form for users to report issues or suggest features.
- Implement user surveys and NPS (Net Promoter Score) to gather user insights.

#### Notifications and Alerts
- Integrate email and SMS notifications for reservation confirmations and reminders.
- Add in-app notifications and alerts for important updates or changes.

#### Improved calendar experiences
- Real time calendar updates, if a another user books an appointment, should fetch that update and make the slot disabled
- Add a date picker / calendar weekly view to make it easier for the user to find the exact date they are looking for. (Filtering, searching also an option but not as great IMO)

#### Improved Navigation
- Implement a more intuitive navigation system with clear call-to-action buttons.
- Add breadcrumb navigation for better user orientation within the application.

#### User Profile and History
- Allow users to create profiles where they can view their past and upcoming reservations.
- Enable users to edit their profile information and manage their preferences.

#### Multilingual Support
- Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.

#### Accessibility Enhancements
- Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags and roles for better screen reader support.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and provide sufficient contrast ratios.

### Engineering and Performance Improvements

#### Scalability and Performance
- Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve performance.
- Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to reduce load times and improve data retrieval speeds.

#### Efficient State Management
- Utilize state management libraries like Redux or Recoil to manage application state efficiently.
- Use context providers to reduce prop drilling and improve code maintainability.

#### Improved Reservation Timeout Handling
- Use web workers to handle the 15-minute reservation timeout in a separate thread.
- Implement a backend job scheduler (e.g., Celery, Sidekiq) to handle timeouts and expirations reliably.

#### Form Validation
- Implement comprehensive form validations using libraries like Formik and Yup to ensure data integrity.
- Add client-side and server-side validations to prevent invalid data submissions.

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js
- Implement Next.js for server-side rendering to improve SEO scores and page load performance.

#### Automated Testing
- Add tests for component interactions using React Testing Library to ensure UI components function correctly.
- Implement Storybook for UI component testing and documentation to maintain design consistency.
- Integration testing to test core flows if this application were needed to be deployed

### GraphQL Integration
- Consider using GraphQL to optimize data fetching and reduce over-fetching.
- Implement Apollo Client for efficient client-side state management with GraphQL.

### Code Optimization
- Use hooks like useCallback and useMemo to optimize functions and handlers that may be reprocessed on client-side re-renders.
- Implement bundle splitting and lazy loading to improve initial load times.

### Error Handling and User Feedback
- Add a global error boundary to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Implement toast notifications to provide immediate feedback for schedule issues or errors.

### Advanced Scheduler
- Implement a comprehensive scheduler that allows users to filter by date and select time slots on a week-by-week view.
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for easy time slot adjustments.
  
### Bundle Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Use Next.js routes for efficient bundle splitting and reduce initial load times.
- Implement lazy loading and virtualization to load only the necessary data and components on demand.
